## üîç Project Overview
### 1. Stock Data Analysis & Portfolio Optimization
- Collect and clean stock data (`yfinance`)  
- Calculate daily returns, risk, volatility, Sharpe ratios  
- Visualize trends, correlations, and market benchmarks (S&P 500)  
- Apply **Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)**  
- Plot Efficient Frontier & Optimal Portfolio  

### 2. Predicting Stock Prices (ML/DL)
- Feature engineering (lags, moving averages, technical indicators)  
- Train regression and deep learning models:  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - LSTM / GRU Neural Networks  
- Evaluate forecasting performance  

### 3. Bank Customer Segmentation
- Apply clustering techniques (KMeans, DBSCAN, Hierarchical)  
- Segment customers based on financial behavior  
- Visualize clusters with PCA & t-SNE  
- Insights for targeted banking strategies  

### 4. Sentiment Analysis on Stock Data
- Collect financial news / tweets  
- Preprocess text (tokenization, stopword removal, embeddings)  
- Apply sentiment models:  
  - Logistic Regression / SVM  
  - LSTM / Transformer-based models (BERT, FinBERT)  
- Correlate sentiment with stock price movement
